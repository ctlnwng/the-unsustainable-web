            From your Instagram photos to your Netflix queue, every byte of data
            that lives on the Internet requires energy to deliver – energy that
            is most likely produced from fossil fuels. The Internet consumes
            energy from data centers, transmission networks, and the end user’s
            physical device, leaving behind a significant carbon footprint.

          <p>
            In a <a href="google.com">2015 report</a> by researchers Anders
            Andrae and Tomas Edler, information and communication technology
            (ICT) was projected to make up 11% of global electricity consumption
            in 2020, for a total electricity demand of approximately 8,265 TWh
            (terawatt hours). As of 2018, this is more than the electricity
            consumption of every country in the world apart from China and the
            United States. It is estimated that the ICT industry accounts for
            roughly 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, matching the carbon
            footprint of the entire air travel industry.

            The following sections provide an overview of a few key players in
            the current conversation surrounding the energy consumption of the
            web: data centers, technology companies, and web developers.
