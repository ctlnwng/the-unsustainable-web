            From your Instagram photos to your Netflix queue, every byte of data
            that lives on the Internet requires energy to deliver – energy that
            is most likely produced from fossil fuels. The Internet consumes
            energy from data centers, transmission networks, and the end user’s
            physical device, leaving behind a significant carbon footprint.

            >
            by researchers Anders Andrae and Tomas Edler, information and
            communication technology (ICT) was projected to make up 11% of
            global electricity consumption in 2020, for a total electricity
            demand of approximately 8,265 TWh (terawatt hours). As of 2018, this
            is more than the electricity consumption of every country in the
            world apart from China and the United States. It is estimated that
            the ICT industry accounts for roughly 2% of global greenhouse gas
            emissions, matching the carbon footprint of the entire air travel
            industry.

          <p>
            The following sections provide an overview of a few key players in
            the current conversation surrounding the energy consumption of the
            web: data centers, technology companies, and web developers.
          </p>

        <section id="data-centers">
          <h2 class="heading">Data Centers</h2>

          <p>
            Behind the interfaces we see in our day-to-day Internet browsing
            routine are hundreds of data centers that store and manage data for
            every online service or application. In 2018, these digital
            factories were estimated to consume approximately 205 TWh of energy,
            which is roughly 1% of global energy demand.
          </p>

          <p>
            The energy efficiency of current data center infrastructure
            certainly has room for improvement. Nicknamed “Data Center Alley”,
            Loudoun County in Northern Virginia boasts the largest cluster of
            data centers in the world, handling 70% of the world’s internet
            traffic. Despite this major energy demand, 85% of Virginia’s energy
            production came from non-renewable sources according to 2017
            statistics reported by the United States Energy Information
            Administration. With Internet traffic projected to grow 24%
            annually, it is crucial that data centers are designed to be as
            energy efficient as possible, especially as they expand to meet
            demand.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="technology-companies">
          <h2 class="heading">Technology Companies</h2>
          <p>
            Since 2010, Greenpeace, a non-governmental environmental
            organization, has been urging major technology companies to commit
            to some form of green energy initiative, such as switching to 100%
            renewably powered data centers or offsetting their company’s carbon
            dioxide emissions in general. According to their 2017 Clicking Clean
            report, dominant tech companies such as Facebook, Apple, and Google
            were among the first to make long-term clean energy commitments back
            in 2011-2012, catalyzing the prioritization of energy efficiency by
            more and more Internet companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, many companies have honored their commitments by building
            data centers in geographic locations that are have greater supplies
            of renewable energy such as Finland and Denmark. Both Apple and
            Google boast data centers that are powered by 100% renewable energy,
            with Apple reporting to have prevented the emission of 2.1 million
            metric tons of carbon dioxide since 2011.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, there are still several companies that demonstrate a lack of
            transparency regarding the sustainability of their operations.
            Greenpeace specifically targeted Amazon Web Services (AWS), the
            largest cloud computing platform in the world, as “completely
            non-transparent about the energy footprint of its massive
            operations,” despite their commitment to 100% renewable energy in
            2014.

        <section id="web-developers">
          <h2 class="heading">Web Developers</h2>
          <p>
            Where does this leave web developers, the ones who are building the
            digital services that shape the web? Website Carbon Calculator, a
            website by London-based agency Wholegrain Digital, calculates the
            amount of CO2 produced every time someone visits a given URL. Their
            calculation involves the amount of data transferred, the energy
            consumption of serving that data, the carbon production of the
            site’s host, and finally, the website’s traffic. They conclude that
            the average website produces 4.61 grams of CO2 per page view.
          </p>

          <p>
            While harnessing renewable energy to power data centers is one
            approach to slow down the Internet’s carbon emissions, an
            alternative approach is to minimize the amount of data that is
            actually transferred. Certain website assets such as images, fonts,
            and scripts add significant bloat to websites and in turn, use
            nonessential bandwidth and energy to deliver to users.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, this website attempts to conserve energy in the
            following ways:
          </p>

          <ul class="web-developers__list">
            <li class="web-developers__list-item">
              <span class="web-developers__li-heading"
                >Content is type set in a system font.</span
              >
              As of March 2020, the average web page makes five font requests
              and loads 127.9 KB in custom font files. Using fonts that are
              already pre-installed on a user’s operating system can bring the
              number of font requests down to zero. This site uses Helvetica, a
              font supported by most operating systems.
            </li>
            <li class="web-developers__list-item">
              <span class="web-developers__li-heading"
                >Images are compressed and used in moderation.</span
              >
              Images are the primary culprit of page bloat and have been
              recorded to take up 1.03 MB/page – nearly half of the average web
              page’s weight. This website has [number of images] images, all
              compressed for a total of [total size of images] KB.
            </li>
            <li class="web-developers__list-item">
              <span class="web-developers__li-heading"
                >Animations are implemented with CSS.</span
              >
              Interactive features on a website are typically implemented in
              JavaScript. However, running less JavaScript improves the energy
              efficiency of a website as less CPU processing is required. This
              site uses browser-optimized CSS animations and transitions in
              favor of programming animations JavaScript.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Web developers can also choose to prioritize optimizing their
            websites for energy efficiency by choosing a green web host. The
            Green Web Foundation provides a directory of green hosts that power
            their servers with clean energy. Altogether, the strain of the
            global climate crisis may fall into the lap of web developers.
            Luckily, they have the means to reduce the carbon footprint of their
            work.

          <p>
            It is important to acknowledge that there are several components
            that make up the infrastructure of the Internet (data centers, wired
            and wireless networks, consumer devices), which makes quantifying
            its carbon footprint a difficult task. However, as the Internet
            expands to support more data, users, and applications, its energy
            demand is nontrivial. Data centers, technology companies, along with
            web developers all play a role in defining our digital future and
            ultimately have a degree of responsibility when it comes to
            mitigating the climate consequences of the rapidly growing web.
