            From your Instagram photos to your Netflix queue, every byte of data
            that lives on the Internet requires energy to deliver – energy that
            is most likely produced from fossil fuels.
          </p>
          <p>How does the Internet actually consume energy?</p>
          <p>
            Before any data appears on your screen, it is stored in giant data
            centers that expend energy to keep computer systems running as well
            as to cool down any overheating. Then, it travels through a wired or
            wireless network, which needs electricity to power networking
            devices such as bridges and routers. Finally, your device itself
            consumes energy to process the delivered data, working hard to
            display your feed or stream your movie. Repeat this process for all
            <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.13&nbsp;billion</a>
            people connected to the web, and it’s clear that the Internet has a
            significant carbon footprint.
          </p>

          <p>
            The amount of energy that the Internet consumes was investigated in
            a frequently cited

              >2015&nbsp;report</a

            by Huawei researchers Anders Andrae and Tomas Edler. They concluded
            that the Internet, referred to as information and communication
            technology (ICT), was projected to make up 11% of global electricity
            consumption in 2020, for a total electricity demand of approximately
            8,265 TWh (terawatt hours).
          </p>
          <p>

            The environmental impact of Internet use is not often a focus in the
            curriculums of those who study technical subjects such as computer
            science, data science, or any other field that leads to a career in
            building online services. As such, this essay will provide an
            overview of the current conversation surrounding the energy
            consumption of the web by examining a few key players that are a
            part of it: data centers, technology companies, and web developers.

          <p>
            Behind the interfaces we see in our day-to-day Internet browsing
            routine are hundreds of data centers that store and manage data for
            every online service or application. In 2018, these digital
            factories were estimated to consume approximately
            <a

          <p>
            The energy efficiency of current data center infrastructure
            certainly has room for improvement. Nicknamed “Data Center Alley”,

            traffic. Despite this major energy demand, 85% of Virginia’s energy
            production came from non-renewable sources according to 2017

            Of course, data centers would not be operative if not for the
            companies that leverage data to create the digital products we
            interface with. Since 2010, Greenpeace, a non-governmental
            environmental organization, has been urging major technology
            companies to commit to some form of green energy initiative, such as
            switching to 100% renewably powered data centers or offsetting their
            company’s carbon dioxide emissions in general. According to their
            2017

            >, dominant tech companies such as Facebook, Apple, and Google were
            among the first to make long-term clean energy commitments back in
            2011-2012, catalyzing the prioritization of energy efficiency by
            more and more Internet companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, many companies have honored their commitments by building
            data centers in geographic locations that are have greater supplies
            of renewable energy such as Finland and Denmark. Both Apple and
            Google boast data centers that are powered by 100% renewable energy,
            with Apple reporting to have prevented the emission of

            Yet, there are still several companies that demonstrate a lack of
            transparency regarding the sustainability of their operations.
            Greenpeace specifically targeted Amazon Web Services (AWS), the
            largest cloud computing platform in the world, as “completely
            non-transparent about the energy footprint of its massive
            operations,” despite their commitment to 100% renewable energy

            Where does this leave web developers, the ones who are actually
            engineering the websites and applications that shape the web?

            produced every time someone visits a given URL. Their calculation
            involves the amount of data transferred, the energy consumption of
            serving that data, the carbon production of the site’s host, and
            finally, the website’s traffic. They conclude that the average
            website produces 4.61 grams of CO2 per page view.

            While powering data centers with renewable energy is one approach to
            slow down the Internet’s carbon emissions, an alternative approach
            is to minimize the amount of data that is actually transferred.
            Certain website assets such as images, fonts, and scripts add
            significant bloat to websites and in turn, use nonessential
            bandwidth and energy to deliver to users.

          <p>
            It is important to acknowledge that quantifying the carbon footprint
            of the Internet is a difficult task as there are several components
            that make up its infrastructure. However, as the Internet expands to
            support more data, users, and applications, its energy demand
            becomes nontrivial as does the need to mitigate any climate
            consequences.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of this is to say that the Internet has a hidden environmental
            impact, even if it sometimes feels like its capacity is infinite.
            Data centers, technology companies, web developers, and anyone else
            who has a hand in defining our online experience should consider
            what a sustainable digital future might look like in the face of the
            rapidly growing web.
